# Inform Games

## Games written with Inform 7

This repository contains interactive fiction games I have authored using the Inform 7 system. The games are not real elaborate and the syntax can likely be cleaned up, but it serves as learning tool for me and a way to have a bit of fun.

To play the games, you will need a Z-machine interpreter such as Frotz, Zoom, or whatever. Clone the repo and open up the zblorb files in your favorite interpreter. Or go ahead and open up the source .inform files in Inform 7 and play from there or even fork this repository and adjust the code.
