OKC CoCo
An Interactive Fiction by Tim Gourley
Release 1 / Serial number 100127 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) SD

Shared Lobby
The lobby echoes and feels cold. It opens to several business but the only one of interest to you is the Oklahoma City Coworking Collaborative, to the north of the lobby. The door stands open and you feel an almost magnetic urge to enter and take part in the magical wonders within.

Social Area
The CoCo&apos;s social area feels open and colorful. Several paintings and photographs from local artists hang on the inner walls while the windows on the outer walls allow ample light to enter the space. It feels welcoming and open. A divider partially hides the meeting space to the east, and to the west is an impenetrable door to the fixed desk area.

You can see a shiny door here.

Long Tunnel
The tunnel stretches out for what seems miles. It is faintly illuminated from some unknown source, but the amount of dust and cobwebs obscures your vision. You hear a faint sound coming from a distance. As you travel down the tunnel, you see a dropoff leading down, with a small rope ladder bolted in place. Should you head down?

You can see a suspicious panel here.
